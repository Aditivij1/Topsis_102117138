TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a multi-criteria decision-making method. It identifies the best alternative by comparing each option to an ideal solution and a worst solution, considering both distance and similarity metrics, aiding in selecting the most optimal choice from a set of alternatives.
